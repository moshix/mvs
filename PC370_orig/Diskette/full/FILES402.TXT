Disk No:  402
Program Title: CROSS ASSEMBLER for the IBM 370 version 4.2 (Disk 1 of 3)
PC-SIG version: 3.3

PC/370 is a cross assembler that runs on the IBM-PC, AT, or XT and lets
you compile and run IBM 370 assembly language programs.

These programs are well-documented with an excellent example demo set up
to be run by a batch file.  This is the most complete emulation of the
VM370 assembler that can be found.  A generous debugging and erase
facility is also given to ease complete development cycles without the
big blue box.

Version 4.2 is loaded with new features, here are just a few:

      o  PC/370 assembler subroutines may now be called from Micro
         Focus COBAL/2 programs running either in extended memory
         protected mode or normal MS-DOS real mode.  Standard linkage
         conventions are supported.  The

      o  PC/370 run time emulator can now be made resident to
         eliminate loading it from disk storage for each program or
         subroutine execution.  As part of making the emulator
         reusable, debug now supports restoring traces.

      o  An optional hardware assist for the CVB and CVD 370
         instructions using the 80x87 math co-processor can speed up
         the instructions by up to a factor of 4.

      o  Two new supervisor calls have been added.  SVC 36 will load a
         program or file into a predefined area of memory (useful for
         overlays), SVC 37 defines user SVC exits for modifying native
         SVC support without requireing the overhead of an emulated
         interrupt driven shell.

      o  The cross assembler now supports the copy statement to allow
         includeing source code files.

      o  The linkage editor now supports option U to allow external
         unresolved references.

Please note that all three disks are required to run this program, the
other numbers in the set are #859 and #1352.
