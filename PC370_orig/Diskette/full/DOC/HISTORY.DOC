    PC/370 R1.0 06/08/85 first freeware release for 8086 MSDOS systems

    A370
    L370
      1.  Force option F to always dynamically load E370.EXE. The
          emulator can no longer be linked with 370 code since L370
          does not process native 8086 assembler object code format.
    E370
      1.  Add SVC's 17-22 to handle extended MSDOS functions such as
          time.

    PC/370 R1.1 11/11/85 maintenance release

    A370
      1.  Allow lower case command line.
      2.  Fix error for zero length data in DC for alignment.
    L370

      2.  Initialize register 13 to standard save area.
      3.  Support 370 instruction address reset via J command.
      4.  Only stop at IFL trace in 370 address stop mode.
      5.  Attempt to close all files when exiting via <esc> command.
    DOC
      1.  Add documentation files describing trace id points.

    PC/370 R1.2 07/18/86 maintenance release plus SEE editor utility

    A370
      1.  Drop form feed on first page heading.
      2.  Translate lower case ASCII comments to upper case.
      3.  Align column headings for cross reference and repeat
          headings.
      4.  Fix error when DC F coded without data - now issues error.
      5.  Rearrange opening of files in pass 2 to insure that no more
          memory is required in pass 2 than in pass 1.  This allows
          number of symbols to directly determine maximum assembly
          possible (SEE is within 30 symbols of maximum now).  Note
          debug was removed from A370 (8k) to provide more symbol
          space.  Also note in pass 2, ALC file buffer will be smaller
          to provide room for object and print file buffers if
          necessary to not exceed pass 1 memory usage.
      6.  Tighten TITLE syntax to require correct leading quote.
    L370
      1.  Drop form feed on first page heading.
      2.  Align column headings with data lines.
      3.  Correct bug causing CSECT reference labels to be truncated.
    E370
      1.  Correct bug in XDECI ASSIST instruction to correctly input
          negative numbers.
      2.  Translate DDNAME to ASCII for SEARCH and DELETE SVC's.
      3.  Reverse DMAS, DMAE, BLKE addresses during OPEN/CLOSE along
          with EODAD and SYNAD addresses to support user defined
          buffer.
      4.  Change debug trace to only trace first ID after IFL in 370
          mode.
      5.  Support trace ID's IOF and ION to turn interrupts off and
          on.
      6.  Fix bug in IOS get text record routine which caused
          premature end of file when DCB was within 128 bytes of
          buffer area due to uninitialized register picking up DCB
          address instead of DMA address during pending EOF
          processing.
      7.  Fix bug in IOS random write routine to increment block
          pointer when writing blocks larger than 128 bytes.
      8.  Change debug to not kill SVC 9 trace entries from 370 code.
      9.  Add SVC 23 to perform RENAME using DCB with EBCDIC names.
          (See SEE.ALC for example use and IHADCB extensions.)
     10.  Add SVC 24 to microcode printing line of ASCII text on
          screen with attribute colors. (used to more than double SEE
          speed).
     11.  Fix memory management to not allocate from last FQE unless
          there is room for a remaining smaller FQE pointer.  Force
          end of memory at x'FF00' to leave room for stack.
     12.  Support S save/unsave debug command to protect current trace
          ID while running in kill mode.  (very useful to obtain high
          speed execution up to selected point in program).
     13.  Save 8086 flags in high R0 for BIOS SVC's such as KEYBOARD.
     14.  Add explicit EBCDIC/ASCII translation and line control
          options to SVC's 0-24 via high bits of R2:
            bit 0 - explicit control if on, else use option E
            bit 1 - force EBCDIC translation if on, else use ASCII
            bit 2 - force addition of line control, else none

            (For example ICM R2,8,=X'80' would force no translation
             and no line control regardless of option E setting.)
     15.  Fix debug N trace listing to translate SVC 9 EBCDIC Id's.

     DOC
      1.  Add SEE.ALC source code utility to edit or browse an ASCII
          text file in full screen color mode.  Keystrokes are
          compatible with Turbo Pascal and PFS:WRITE.  The editor
          supports files up to 512k.  SEE includes character graphics
          to support line drawings and organizational chart drawings.
          SEE also supports creation of session keystroke file (.KSF)
          which can be reused to recreate SEE session with full screen
          colors and with keyboard pause and wait control.
      2.  Add PRINT.ALC source code utility to print source programs
          and PC370.DOC documentation file with page control.
      3.  Add information on electronic bulletin board and PC-SIG
          distribution via disk #402.
      4.  Add DW3NUM.ALC source code utility to insert line numbers on
          all non-blank lines in a Displaywrite III text document.
          Numbers are placed in left margin and reset at beginning of
          each page.  This program serves as a model for other
          utilities that could be written to process Displaywrite III
          document files directly.  This utility squeezes file and
          lists file on console in the process of inserting line
          numbers.
      5.  Drop form feed on first page heading for PRINTDOC.ALC.

    PC/370 R2.0 05/16/87 major update with 512 address space support

    A370
      1.  Converted to EXE format with 64k data segment and buffer
          segment.
      2.  Now supports 3 times as many labels and literals.
      3.  File handle I/O with pathing much more efficient.
      4.  Fix error if DSECT's contain anything but DS instructions.
      5.  Allow references to ENTRY symbols within same module.
    L370
      1.  Converted to EXE format with 64k data segment and buffers
          segment.
      2.  Now supports code modules up to 50k.
      3.  File handle I/O with pathing much more efficient.
      4.  New option M creates 370 MOD file without COM prefix.
    E370
      1.  Converted to EXE format running in high 64k segment.
      2.  The standard instruction set plus ASSIST now supports
          direct addressing up to the maximum available memory
          under MS-DOS 2.0+ (512k+).
      3.  Error in one byte overlapped pack instruction corrected.
      4.  Error in BXH and BXLE with negative updated index values
          fixed.
      5.  Memory management now supports the full address space
          using 8 byte free queue elements (4 byte address and
          4 byte length).  ASCASF FQE chain pointer is located at
          X'118'in new address space control block.  The same
          registers for SVC 10 and 11 are used.
      6.  File management support has been rewritten using MS-DOS
          file handle I/O to support pathing and random or
          sequential access to multiple files.  Each file can
          have up to 64K buffer.  Maximum files open is
          controlled by CONFIG.SYS FILES= parameter.  See
          DOC\SYSTEM.DOC and CPY\IHADCB.CPY for more information.
      7.  The interactive debug facility has been expanded to
          provide additional support for virtual address space
          separate from emulator address space.  The Z command
          determines which address space functions refer to.  The
          debug facility is included in A370 and L370 as well as
          E370.  A new "I" command added, dumps full word counter
          which is source record count in A370, logical object record
          in L370, and 370 instruction counter in E370.  Address stop
          on this word can be used to stop execution at any desired
          point.  However, note that in kill mode, the counter may be
          incremented more than once between trace ids preventing
          address stop on equal from triggering.
      8.  The interface between linked COM modules and the E370.EXE
          emulator has been redesigned to use the MS-DOS standard EXEC
          function instead of somewhat non-standard overlay load.  Now
          the first 16 bytes of each linked COM module contains the
          EXEC mainline which links to E370.EXE in the high 64k of
          available memory.  E370.EXE initializes the virtual address
          space origin 16 bytes past the beginning of the COM module
          with executable code starting at X'210' into module or
          relative X'200'.  COM mainline will abort if there is not
          room for COM module plus 64k for E370.EXE.
      9.  E370.EXE now supports SVC 25 to load any kind of file
          including linked COM files into free memory.  See
          DOC\SYSTEM.DOC and CPY\IHASCB.CPY.
     10.  E370.EXE now supports SVC 26 an 27 for attach and detach of
          COM 370 programs which run in their own relative address
          spaces.  See DEMO\DEMOPSW series of demo programs for
          example.
     11.  Fix trace and PSW address of EX target instructions.

    PC/370 R2.0A 05/24/87 fixes to 2.0

    A370
      1.  EQU's preceeding first CSECT caused 0 length blank CSECT
          error.
    L370
    E370
      1.  Error in Freemain svc 11 when releasing block between two
          existing free blocks chained to third free block.
      2.  I/O supervisor now takes SYNAD exit if bad RBA causes random
          read or write to fail due to pointing beyond disk capacity.

    PC/370 R3.0  08/30/87 new macro preprocessor, floating point,
          scientific subroutines, generic interrupt SVC, ASCII string
          constants, MVS shell demo with SIO channel simulator
    A370
      1.  Support for E, D, and L floating point constants added.
      2.  ASCII string constants in double quotes added and self
          defining string constants fixed to handle C'''' etc.
      3.  Error in DS or DC destroyed location counter causing
          additional erroneous base errors in following instructions.
      4.  Treat blank lines like comments instead of syntax errors.
    L370
      1.  Error in concatenating object files when previous file ends
          exactly on 128 block boundary.
      2.  Add option I to surpress all interrupts during execution.
      3.  Add option P to surpress floating point even if 80x87 avail.
    E370
      1.  Floating point instructions added using 80x87.
      2.  SVC's 28-35 added to assist use of ASCII strings, generic
          interrupt to issue any MS-DOS or BIOS interrupt with user
          defined PC registers, plus scientific subroutine assist
          using 80x87 routines for square root, 2**X, tangent,
          arctangent, logs.
      3.  Fixed ASCII file output translation option (was translating
          after write) in PUT svc.
      4.  Correct ASCII/EBCDIC translation of left bracket and GE
          symbols.
      5.  Correct debug jump command to handle addresses over 64k in
          370 mode.
      6.  Correct MP to return specification error if L'A LE L'B, L'B
          GT 8, or high bytes of A for length L'B not zero.

    PC/370 R3.1  09/02/87 maintenance to R3.0 based on user feedback

    A370
      1.  Fix error in object code ORG when DS is used in multiple
          CSECT module causing L370 link error due to ORG exceeding
          length of CSECT (offset to start of non-zero CSECT was not
          being subtracted to calculate relative CSECT ORG address).
          Explicit ORG's worked fine, only a DS generated ORG caused
          error.
    L370
    E370

    PC/370 R3.2  09/07/87 maintenance to R3.1 based on user feedback

    A370
      1.  Allow maximum 80 character ALC source with seq. #.
      2.  Fix label equated to CSECT/DSECT which caused L370 errors.
      3.  Flag DC error for RLD's for DSECT labels which caused L370
          errors.
    L370
    E370
      1.  Fix ZAP to correct regression bug with R2.0 where any number
          with zero in low nibble gives positive sign and zero
          condition.

    PC/370 R4.0  11/08/87 maintenance to R3.1 based on user feedback

    A370
      1.  Add support for COPY statement to include source code from
          any MS-DOS path\filename.  The default suffix is CPY.
    L370
      1.  Add option B to create file identical to COM file but with
          suffix BIN for use with Micro Focus COBOL.
    E370
      1.  Support resident option invoked by directly executing the
          emulator EXE module.
      2.  Support calls from Micro Focus COBOL in resident mode using
          standard linkage conventions and V=R addressing mode.
      3.  Modify OPEN logic to allow use of SYNAD exit even though
          file may not be open due to error such as file not found.
          Add error and function codes in R0 and R1 for use by SYNAD
          exit in determining error (see LIB\SYNERROR.ALC).

    PC/370 R4.1  11/20/87 maintenance to R4.0 based on user feedback

    A370
      1.  Correct ORG to correctly handle CSECT or DSECT name as well
          as any relative expression (The code was only allowing
          relative expression operand rather than special label type).
    L370

    E370
      1.  Correct serious bug in release 4.0 which stores 8 byte free
          queue element directly after the end of each BIN module.
          (This code to build free area behind COM modules can cause
          COBOL run time system to crash after exiting from
          subroutine depending on use of area overlayed).
      2.  Add optional parameter to define size of system queue area
          (SQA) memory in the resident emulator address space for use
          by COBOL subroutines.  Size is in hex paragraphs and default
          is 10 or 256 bytes.  Through use of SQA, COBOL subroutines
          can now perform standard file I/O with dynamic buffer
          allocation (See BAT\RUNCBL.BAT demo for example SQA and
          I/O use).
      3.  Enhance interactive debug to support resident reusability by
          restoring all traces at beginning of each COM execution and
          at beginning of all COBOL subroutines called with option D
          specified at link edit.  Also toggle command K can be used
          to restore traces at any point in program execution (This
          allows quickly reaching a selected point in program and then
          restoring traces for complete instruction tracing).
      3.  Support user defined standard COBOL return code using value
          in register 15 (low 16 bits) at exit.

    PC/370 R4.2  01/05/88 Micro Focus XM protected mode support

    A370
    L370
      1.  Add option U to allow undefined external references.
    E370
      1.  Support Micro Focus XM COBOL protected mode call to PC/370
          assembler subroutine in BIN file (See USER.DOC for more).
          The resident interrupt was moved from hex DC to hex 60.
          (See PTF.DOC for fix to change interrupt # if it conflicts.)
      2.  Fix 0C9 on CVB with negative zero packed decimal input.
      3.  Correct EBCDIC to ASCII translate tables to handle
          > { and [ conversion in both directions (half fixed in 3.0).
      4.  Flag error for text file with LRECL<2.
      5.  Fix SRP to use only low 6 bits in second operand for shift.
          (If the 6 bit number was positive, 8 bits were used.)
      6.  MVS standard parm list with address, half word count, and
          EBCDIC parm field is now pointed to by R1 at entry.
      7.  If floating point option is on and 80X87 is installed,
          hardware assist is used for CVB and CVD to speed up
          instruction by up to 4 times for large numbers.
      8.  Add MVS program interruption element (PIE) control block
          pointed to by R2 at entry to SPIE trap.  This allows full
          recovery from trap without losing content of registers.
          (See CPY\IHAPIE.CPY for more information.)
      9.  Fix incorrect PSW on exception of executed instruction.
     10.  Add SVC 36 to load overlay file at specified virtual
          address.
     11.  Add SVC 37 to define SVC user exit table.
          See DEMO\DEMOTRAP.ALC for examples.
     12.  Add production version of emulator E370P42.EXE without
          interactive debug or ASSIST facility to save 10k.
