Chapter 1.  Introduction

*********

The PC/370 system supports a number of supervisor services through
the standard 370 SVC interface.  In supervisor state, each SVC invokes
pseudo microcode which performs the function requested at native
processor speed.  In problem state each SVC causes a standard SVC
interrupt storing the current PSW at location X'20' and loading the
new PSW from location X'60'.  Supervisor call routines can be user
written to map any SVC into any desired function in problem state.

In supervisor state, svc's 1-7 provide a set of input and output
facilities using MS-DOS file handle I/O and an extended data control
block defined by the user which allows access to sequential and random
files.  Svc's 10-11 provide virtual memory dynamic management.  In
addition to the other misc. functions provided, svc 34 provides a
general purpose interrupt interface which can be used to map PC/370
area into PC registers and issue any MS-DOS function call or BIOS
interrupt.  Svc's 128-191 map into BIOS interrupts using simple
register to register mapping.  Svc's 200-241 map into MS-DOS function
calls 0-41 using simple register to register mapping.  Note function
calls above 41 can be issued using svc 34 interface which is the
preferred method for future releases.

The PC/370 supervisor calls to the I/O supervisor all require register
2 to point to the DCB.  The SVC's are as follows:

 SVC  FUNCTION  OPTIONS

   1  OPEN
   2  CLOSE
   3  READ      register 1 must be address of block or zero
   4  WRITE     register 1 must be address of block or zero
   5  GET       register 1 must be address of area or zero
   6  PUT       register 1 must be address of area or zero
   7  DELETE
   8  SEARCH
  23  RENAME

The PC/370 system supports sequential and random access to
files using MS-DOS file handle I/O with directory pathing.
To access a file, a data control block (DCB) must be defined
in the program with fields defined as shown in the dummy
section (DSECT) called IHADCB found in CPY\IHADCB.CPY and
demonstrated in UTIL\PRINTDOC.ALC.   All fields must be defined
prior to open and cannot be changed while the file is open
with the exception of RCD, BUF, and RBA as described below.

An explanation of each field in the DCB follows:

  1.  DCBDCB - DCB identifier consisting of the four EBCDIC
               characters ADCB.  These characters are
               verified each time an I/O routine is called
               with the address of the DCB in register 2.
               An attempt is made to exit to the synchronous
               error exit address if there is no match.

  2.  DCBDSN - address of up to 64 character EBCDIC path and
               file name followed by a zero byte.  This field
               is automatically translated to ASCII as
               required.

  3.  DCBFID - MS-DOS assigned file handle at open time.
               This field must be initialized to high values
               or open routine will assume file is already
               open and take SYNAD exit.

  4.  DCBFLG - file condition flags used by I/O routines.
               This field must be initialized to zero except
               user defined buffer bit DFUBUF and user
               requested ASCII file conversion bit DFTRAN may
               be turned on.  No other bits may be modified
               by user.  If the DFTRAN (X'08') bit is set, input
               records are translated to EBCDIC in the record area.
               Output records are translated to ASCII in the record
               area, written, and then translated back to EBCDIC.
               The entire LRECL area is translated.  For text mode,
               each record must end with EBCDIC line feed.

  5.  DSORG  - data set organization EBCDIC code:

                 S for sequential
                 R for random file access.

  6.  MACRF  - data set access EBCDIC code:

                 R for read block with length of BLKSZ
                 W for write block with length of BLKSZ
                 (note PRECL can override BLKSZ on write)
                 G for get logical record into RCD area
                 P for put logical record form RCD area

  7.  RECFM  - data set record format EBCDIC code:

                 F - fixed length records with length LRECL
                     for get/put sequential access or length
                     BLKSZ for read/write random or
                     sequential access.
                 V - variable length records with length
                     stored in first 2 bytes (valid lengths
                     range from 3 to 64k).  Maximum length
                     allowed for a file is LRECL and only
                     sequential get/put modes supported.
                 T - text records ending with end of record
                     code (EOR usually X'0A' line feed).
                     Maximum length allowed for a file is
                     LRECL and only sequential get/put modes
                     supported.

  8.  EOR    - end of record code for text (default NL X'0A')

  9.  EOF    - end of file code for text (default X'1A')

 10.  LRECL  - length of logical record. Maximum is 64K less 17 bytes.
               Minimum is 3 for RECFM=V, 2 for RECFM=T or 1 for
               RECFM=F.

 11.  BLKSZ  - length of block.  Maximum is 64K less 17 bytes
               and minimum is 3.  If zero is specified, a
               default block of 8k will be dynamically
               allocated and deallocated at open and close
               respectively.  BLKSZ should be specified for
               read/write access.  For sequential access,
               larger block size reduces contention between
               multiple files by reading or writing entire
               blocks at one time rather than for each
               record.  If insufficient memory is available,
               the maximum available will be allocated.

 12.  EODAD  - end of file exit address. This cannot be changed
               while file is open.

 13.  SYNAD  - synchronous error exit.  This cannot be changed while
               file is open.  If register 2 does not point to a valid
               DCBDCB ID field not exit is taken and interactive debug
               is invoked.  If exit is taken, register 0 contains
               error code and register 1 contains function code which
               can be used by to produce error message by calling
               subroutine LIB\SYNERROR.ALC which is in the default
               system relocatable library L370.LIB.

 14.  RCD    - record area address for get/put only.  This
               address may be changed on each get or put by
               placing new address in register 1.  If register 1
               contains zero, then current DCB area will be used.

 15.  BLK    - block area address used for direct I/O via MS-
               DOS.  If DFUBUF is not set at open, this area
               is dynamically allocated and deallocated using
               BLKSZ or default for length.  If DFUBUF is set, then
               new block address can be set for each read or write
               by placing new address in register 1.  If register 1
               contains zero, then current DCB block will be used.

 16.  RBA   -  relative byte address for random access
               read/write.  First byte of file is zero.  This field
               must be reset for each random read or write.

 17.  REN   -  address of file rename followed by zero.
               Only used by RENAME SVC.  Both DCBDSN and REN must be
               initialized in a closed DCB prior to RENAME SVC 23.

 18.  IOCNT -  physical I/O count since open.  Larger
               BLKSZ will reduce physical I/O count for
               sequential file access.

 19.  PRECL -  physical record length on last read or
               write.  This field is initialized to zero
               at open.  On write, BLKSZ will be calculated
               if this field is zero, else this field will
               override length allowing short blocks to be
               written.  This is useful in processing files
               of unknown length with fixed block logic.
               The last block read may be short, and the
               corresponding last block written may be short.

Do not modify the reserved areas which are only used by
PC/370 IOS while file is open.  See UTIL\PRINTDOC.ALC for
example of file access method.

                   preallocated area.

The PC/370 system includes support for dynamic loading and execution
of 370 modules assembled and linked by A370.EXE and L370.EXE.
Any file including COM and MOD type files can be loaded into free
memory by use of the LOAD SVC 25.  The only argument required is
the address of the path and file name in register 1.  The file name
must end with a suffix of the form .XXX or a zero byte.  The largest
free memory area will be allocated and the file loaded into it.
Register 0 will be set to the address of the area, and register 1 will
be set to the length of the file.  The unused portion of the allocated
area will be freed.  If the load operation was successful, register 15
will be set to zero, else it will be set to 1.  Demo test program
DEMOSVC.ALC illustrates the use of the load function to load an 8086
assembly language subroutine and execute it via user exit SVC 15.

Any 370 COM file created by L370.EXE and loaded via the load SVC 25
above, can be executed it its own address space via the attach SVC 26.
Register 0 must be set to point to the COM file (set by load SVC 25)
and register 1 must be set to address space size (minimum set by load
SVC 25),  If additional space is to be included in the attached
address space for dynamic use via GETMAIN/FREEMAIN SVC's 10/11, then
the area to be added must be allocated in the mother address space
prior to issuing attach SVC 26 and the total length of the COM file
plus the allocated free space placed in register 1.  A COM file can be
executed multiple times via attach by reloading registers 0 and 1 and
reissuing SVC 26.  On second and following calls, the same address
space control block built on the first call in the COM prefix area
is reused (See CPY\IHASCB.CPY for layout) since it overlays original
COM prefix data.

Execution of the attached address space can be terminated via a detach
SVC 27 which restores the mother address space and continues execution
at the next instruction following the attach SVC 26.  The only other
way to terminate the attached address space normally is to issue an
exit SVC 0 which exits directly to MS-DOS.  A detach SVC 27 in an
address space which has no mother, will cause exit to MS-DOS.

An alternative to using attach/detach to execute dynamically loaded
370 code is to use simple branch and link.  For 370 code linked into
COM file, the 370 code starts X'210' from the beginning of the COM
file.  For code linked into MOD type file by L370.EXE using option M,
the 370 code starts immediately at the beginning of the file (i.e. the
file load address returned in register 0 by load SVC 25).

For example of each type program loading and execution, see
DEMO\MVS.ALC and DEMO\DEMOPSW.ALC demo programs.

The virtual address space established for the execution of COM files
created by L370.EXE has the following memory layout.  For a sample
DSECT of the address space control block, see CPY\IHASCB.CPY.

                         interrupt.  Note segment:offset addresses
                         such as DS:DX, DS:SI, or ES:DI required
                         by interrupts can be calculated via SVC 32.
                         Likewise returned segment:offset results can
                         be translated back to PC/370 virtual
                         addresses via SVC 33.  This is a very
                         powerful and therefore dangerous instruction.
                         SVC's 128-191 and SVC's 200-241 should be
                         used in place of this more general SVC when
                         possible since they are a little faster (they
                         don't load and store all PC registers and
                         don't require PCVT setup).  They are also
                         much safer since an error in PCVT setup could
                         invoke wrong interrupt or pass bad registers
                         to any function including reboot interrupt,
                         write to disk, etc SVC 34 does verify PCVT
                         identifier and range of PCIN within 0-255.
                         If verify fails, program interruption
                         19 occurs.  If carry bit is set by interrupt,
                         condition code 3 is set, else condition code
                         0 is set.

                         have maximum file length allowed to be loaded
                         in preallocated area.

     37  SVCTRAP         Define svc trap table via register 1 which
                         contains address of user exit routine to be
                         used with each svc.  If register 1 is zero
                         current svc trap table is cancelled.  After
                         table is defined, each svc call functions as
                         follows:

                           1.  If table+4*(svc #) contains zero,
                               execute real PC/370 svc normally.
                           2.  If svc trap active mode is set,
                               execute real PC/370 svc normally.
                           3.  If table+4*(svc #) is not zero,
                               store current psw at old svc psw x'20',
                               set trap active mode, and branch to
                               trap exit address in table entry.

                         LPSW instruction will always reset trap
                         active mode, and normal exit from trap
                         is via LPSW OLDSVC.  All svc calls within
                         trap routine including the svc which
                         invoked trap will process as real svcs
                         normally without storing psw.  See DEMO\
                         DEMOTRAP.ALC program for examples.

          One of the most frequently used SVC's is 209 (write to
          operator).  For example, to print message on standard output
          device via MS-DOS function call 9, the following 2 PC/370
          instructions can be used:

           LA  R2,=C'THIS IS A DEMO WTO MESSAGE$'
           SVC 209

          The above example will print message on console and issue
          carriage return and line feed following message ending with
          $.  To turn off automatic carriage return and line feed,
          issue SVC 31 prior to SVC 209.  To eliminate overhead of
          converting from default EBCDIC strings to ASCII for 209,
          issue SVC 29 prior to SVC 209 and use PC/370 assembler
          extension for ASCII strings in double quotes.  For
          example, this is the most efficient method of issuing
          messages:

            SVC 29  TURN OFF EBCDIC TO ASCII CONVERSION FOR 209
             .
             .

 A.  Introduction

     PC/370 release 4.0 contains support for the entire 370 floating
     point instruction set using the Intel 80x87 co-processor.  If the
     co-processor is not installed, all floating point instructions
     cause operation exceptions as they would on a 370 without the
     floating point option.  There is a new option in the L370 linkage
     editor (option P) which can be used to force turning off floating
     point option even when co-processor is installed.  Default is to
     support floating point if it is installed and 370 module has been
     linked using release 3.0+ linkage editor.  In addition to the
     standard floating point instructions, two additional levels of
     support have been added.  Section F describes a set of SVC's
     which invoke extended microcode functions on the 80x87 chip such
     as square root, logs, etc.  These SVC's are fast but most require
     special scaling of arguments.  DOC\USER.DOC describes a set of
     scientific subroutines written in ALC which can be called to
     efficiently calculate functions over extended range of real
     numbers.

 B.  Data formats

     The Intel 80x87 actually only supports one IEEE floating point
     format which has 64 bit mantissa and exponent range of 10**4932
     which exceeds both the 370 short and long (double precision)
     formats of 24 and 56 bit mantissa's.  Therefore, both the short
     and long operations are done with extra precision.  The 370
     extended format instructions are all supported but the precision
     actually available is only 64 bits versus the 112 on a 370.  When
     short and long numbers are loaded into the 80x87, they are padded
     with zeros to the 64 bit length required.  When an extended
     number is loaded into the 80x87, the last 8 bits are obtained
     from the second register in the specified extended register pair.
     The PC/370 cross assembler now supports E, D, and L data formats
     when the 80x87 is installed.

 C.  Data exceptions

     The standard 370 exponent overflow, exponent underflow, and
     floating point divide exceptions are all supported.  The program
     mask can be set to control whether program exception is allowed.
     One deviation from standard 370 convention, is to return the
     maximum floating point number with correct sign when overflow
     occurs instead of an invalid number.  This is consistent with
     IEEE standard.

 D.  Floating point instructions

     1.  Note that all operations are normalized using 80x87 and that
         the 370 unnormalized function identical to normalized
         instructions.

     2.  Compare short and long include all 64 bits in comparison.  To
         round number to specific number of bits in short or long
         format, use the LRER or LRDR instruction prior to compare.

 E.  Interactive debug facilities for floating point

     1.  When floating point support is active (i.e. option P is on
         and the 80x87 co-processor is installed), the R command will
         display third line with floating point register contents in
         hex.  Note that the actual floating point register areas in
         memory are stored in 80x87 temporary real format to allow
         register to register instructions to execute faster since no
         conversion from or to 370 format is required.

 F.  Extended 80x87 microcoded arithmetic functions

     The following extended arithmetic floating point functions are
     supported via SVC 35 with the function number in register 1.
     Arguments and results are in the floating point registers F0 and
     F2.

     #   Formula:                Notes:

     1.  F0 = LOG10(2)           constant
     2.  F0 = LOGE(2)            constant
     3.  F0 = LOG2(E)            constant
     4.  F0 = LOG2(10)           constant
     5.  F0 = PI                 constant 3.14159....
     6.  F0 = ARCTAN(F2/F0)      0 <= F2 <= F0 < IFI (infinity)
     7.  F2/F0 = TAN(F0)         0 <= F0 <= PI/4 (sets F0 and F2)
     8.  F0 = SQRT(F0)           0 <= F0 < IFI
     9.  F0 = F2 * LOG2(F0)      0 < F0 < IFI, -IFI < F2 < IFI
    10.  F0 = F2 * LOG2(F0+1)    0 <= F0 < (1-(SQRT(2)/2)), _IFI < F2
                                 < IFI
    11.  F0 = 2**F0              -IFI < F0 < IFI (note 1)
    12.  F0 = R0                 convert to real
    13.  R0 = F0                 convert to integer
    14.  F0 = MOD(F0/F2)         return fraction of F0 mod F2 in F0
                                 (note 2)
    15.  F0 = SIN(F0)            argument may be any real radian value
                                 (note 3)
    16.  F0 = COS(F0)            argument may be any real radian value
                                 (note 3)
    17.  F0 = TAN(F0)            argument may be any real radian value
                                 (note 3)

   Notes:

     1.  This function uses equivalence expression to derive 2**F0 for
         all values of F0 rather than just the 0.0-0.5 range supported
         via the F2XM1 80x87 instruction.

     2.  Note this uses FPREM 80x87 instruction repeatedly to
         calculate exact remainder via successive subtraction.

     3.  Note 15-17 perform scaling of argument via FPREM 80x87
         instruction and use FPTAN 80x87 instruction to derive
         tangent, sine and cosine.

   Register 15 is set to one of the following values at exit from svc:

    hex

     00 - no errors detected
     80 - 80x87 not operational
     40 - invalid function number in register 1
     20 - 80x87 precision error (inexact result such as 1/3 etc.)
     10 - 80x87 underflow error (zero returned)
     08 - 80x87 overflow  error (max 370 value returned)
     04 - 80x87 zero divide     (max 370 value returned)
     02 - 80x87 denormalized operand error (should not occur)
     01 - 80x87 invalid operation error    (should not occur)
