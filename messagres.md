MVS Messages Naming
===================


The first three, occasionally four, characters of the component/program name identify the program, and usually, serve to identify the error messages issued by the program.  Many of the prefixes originated in the OS/360 era, or earlier, and the origin of the prefix letters is no longer known.  Currently IBM maintains a registry of prefixes assigned both by IBM and by third parties.  Some of the known prefixes are:
